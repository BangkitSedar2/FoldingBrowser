=====================
All-in-One Installer:
=====================

---------------------------
Ideas, Improvements, Tasks:
---------------------------

-Simplicity: Ideally, you only want to enter username and email, and you are up and Folding.

-Simple version of the FoldingBrowser: mostly to only run the FAH NaCl Chrome Plugin client
-Simple user install: Tokenly Pockets wallet chrome plugin (like the new setup FoldingCoin website instructions say) -Build our own version of the plugin for FLDC?
-Plugin: Ad Blocker?
-Plugin: Rare Pepe Wallet?

-Add button titles and links to a separate INI file, that can be replaced to update
-Display the FAH advanced config options from --help (Show Commands button?: Show in a separate window from the FAH username dialog) The text is probably copyrighted, so maybe run the EXE and grab the output to display. Might be better to leave out.
-Create backup copies of the settings in a 'Backup' folder periodically?
-Reminder on a time interval to make backups of settings on to a USB drive?

-INI: when encryption PW is blank, use last PW and prompt for it (for extra security for not keeping the PW in a text file in your user account)? -Or, have a flag in INI to prompt for PW or use the one in the INI?

-Set FAH option for 'Only When Idle' during install? (to avoid the system being sluggish during install)
-Option to monitor FAH clients and restart them if they hang?

-Encryption: use constant internally, Prompt for PW if encryption fails. Option to Store PW in INI file to not be prompted for it, or Don't store PW an be prompted often for it (if it's not the default).
-Make a better way to determine if the DAT file loads. This won't work: DAT.ToString.Length = 0, it really needs to be .SaveToString(), but all you want to know is there data loaded or not. You don't need a full text string output...
-For showing Wallet info, have option to 7-zip the INI/DAT file to add a password or not to it?
-Button to delete all saved info for a Wallet Id?
-Restore from backup button (or separate app)? Make something to make setting up multiple computers easier (rename existing files, and copy new one) (and telnet FAH settings from Config file)

-Add pauses? (timer / do events) to the automated process to break it up and allow error to work themselves out. Might not be needed...
-Add stop button to cancel the automated process?

-Get Wallet with CounterPart API instead of current methods? (or use Tokenly Pockets Plugin for this)
-Support other block explorers?  like: (Using:)https://xchain.io/     (depreciated) https://counterpartychain.io/      https://chain.so/      https://walletapp.indiesquare.me/explorer/      https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/<addy>      https://xcpdex.com/
-Mempool Transaction Count: https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-count?timespan=1week     Use: https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ and https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h to help determine sufficient miners fees to keep your TX from getting stuck in the mempool

-Improve the CureCoin HTTP JSON-RPC to use the JSON parser, and find the wallet if there is more than one entry or (blank and a name)
-Show image of where to get the CURE wallet address, for message when it can't be found
-Improve the CureCoin pool sign up process, search for: account created / captcha failed massages? Search for User/PW being blank and fill them in for Capcha retries (fill in initially, too). Stop/Exit the process? Better retries for captcha fail / retry. Reload the info periodically?
-Make the other webpage wait loops use Javascript for detecting stuff is there (like the CureCoin webpage login)
-Option to start the CureCoin wallet (if not running) for POS purposes?

-GitHub: An installer download link that doesn't change for FoldingCoin / CureCoin website links?

-Test out the FLDC Bar Electron app
-Try '.NET Core' simple sample project, to get a feel for it, especially for Linux and MacOS.
-Linux & Mac executables & install packages (or a live image you can just run off a USB drive?)

-Any updates needed for CureCoin 2.0 changes?
-Other CureCoin websites: https://curecoin.info     https://curecoin.io/      (Using:) http://curecoin.net/

-Change to the new username format (Nope, not yet, as of June)


---------------
Immediate Need:
---------------
-Enable Multi-language support in the FoldingBrowser app
-Simple version of the FoldingBrowser: mostly to only run the FAH NaCl Chrome Plugin client. -Would switching to the Electron framework be better?
-Add notify icon (system tray icon) for folding with NaCl Chrome Plug-in (add option to enable / disable exiting on program close)


-INI: option to set initial page to any URL, with radio buttons for: local portal page, FLDC homepage, CURE homepage, CounterWallet?, blank?

-Support other wallets?  like:  https://freewallet.io/     (Using:)https://counterwallet.io/    wallet.indiesquare.me    also: rarepepewallet.com would work
-Use built-in multi-language uninstaller strings for uninstaller dialog on upgrading?

-Improve the portal web page (eliminate some buttons in the browser?)
-Add FLDC & CURE Ticker info from Coin Market Cap API (or pull from exchanges?). Update hourly? Do as notify icon? Might not be worth it, if the FLDC homepage gets it. See:  https://coinmarketcap.com/api/    https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/CureCoin/
-Add option to get Wallet info from blockchain explorer APIs to display value? FLDC- counterpartychain.io     CURE-  https://chainz.cryptoid.info/cure
-Save some stats from API data, and show difference from last time, or from a past time interval?

-CTRL+F5: to dump the cache like Chrome? Or a button to manually (unload the browser component), dump the cache, (and reload the browser)?
-CTRL+F: Find text in a page functionality? (searching for BTC address on distribution page, etc)

======================================================================================================
Release Notes - Tasks completed:
======================================================================================================


v13 Release (8/4/2017)
[DONE] -Fixing the portal homepage, to open either page full screen
[DONE] -Allow old username format of BTC address only, and must be on the FoldingCoin Team with a warning about not being able to earn CURE
[DONE] -Limit FAH username to 2 underscores. 3+ underscores are not parsed but the current distribution server (likely to be updated soon)
[DONE] -Block against special characters in FAH username, and especially block "@" for email addresses as a username, which looses everything after "@". See: http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/stats-teams-usernames/ -"If you choose your email address as your username, we will use the full email address but NOT print the full email address. Instead, just the part before the @ sign will be used in any stats listing, etc."
[DONE] -Show language selection box in the installer (Danish Windows selected the first alphabetical language, like Arabic. So, did the CureCoin wallet software, according to the user)
[DONE] -Make the CureCoin Folding Pool Login button like the others, to make it more accessible for people who use it more often
[DONE] -Remove the FLDC 'Stats' button (FLDC.tech is discontinued for now)
v12 Release (6/9/2017)
[DONE] -Update CureCoin installer to v1.9.2.1

v9 Release (3/4/2017)
[DONE] -Add note about how CureCoin's POS works, mostly for new users
[DONE] -Check for the Wallet.dat file existing to set the checkbox for the CureCoin folding pool setup? (would need to detect this in the installer before installing / launching it from the installer)

[DONE] -Message to leave the CURE wallet open
[DONE] -Saved Data: 'Add New or Existing Info' checkbox: Renamed to: Show Raw Data, and inverted what it does

(Skip) -The CefSharp black pop-up console window from the FoldingCoin website says "NOT SANDBOXED" for less than a second. Looking into this: it's marked as a 'Won't Fix' issue, so just keep ignoring it...
v8 Release (2/4/2017)
[DONE] -Install complete message: also add for questions or feedback please contact us on Slack
[DONE] -Improve last message for Install complete, to say the Distribution intervals (FLDC = Monthly, CURE = Daily).
[DONE-2/4/2017] -Fix tabbing order of form items to be correct.
[DONE] -Have button to Slack for FLDC and CURE
[DONE] -Make the 1 day date range for the FLDC Distribution link?

[DONE] -Press forward / Back, then set focus/activate the address bar(when they get disabled, focus goes to the My Wallet button)

[DONE] -Update CefSharp to v53 (use NuGet)[DONE]. Update to a .NET v4.5.2 target[DONE]

[DONE-12/5/2016] -Spell check source code.
